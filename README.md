# sonic-acts-2000

Intiall attempt into piecing together a sonic acts website using infromation from the wayback machine

To assemble the website, this attempt makes use of the [Wayback Machine Downloader](https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader)

it is  good to remember that Wayback Machine, archives sites incrementally, so if you have have to check when a page was archived, do another download request and then assemble the website manually.
