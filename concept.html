Sonic Acts stages and presents their work and artistic experiments in a professional venue for a mixed audience consisting of specifically interested art-lovers as well as a general public for dance and popmusic. Sonic Acts expressly offers its participants ample opportunity to meet, exchange views, and possibly even co-operate or perform as an ad hoc-formation.<br>						<br>						Ever since its first edition in 1994, Sonic Acts has been an important platform for the presentation of new attitudes amongst young artists, who by their preference of interdisciplinary art, confrontations, blending and fusing, presently transform arts and culture into an as yet little known domain of cultural and artistic practices. Sonic Acts, moreover, plays quite an important role in disseminating these attitudes and its products, as well as stimulating the professional development of participating artists, some of them students at the time.<br>						<br>						Sonic Acts started from the co-operation between Paradiso Amsterdam and the Interfaculty of Image and Sound of the Royal Academy/Conservatory in The Hague. In former years Sonic Acts co-operated closely with a large number of artists and with institutional partners, like Theatre group Hollandia, STEIM (foundation for Electro-Instrumental Music) and the Institute of Sonology.<br>						For future editions of Sonic Acts, starting in 2000, a new, independent, editorial board was installed, consisting of young artists: Arnold Hoogerwerf, Remco de Jong, Remco Schuurbiers, Florentijn Boddendijk, Sanne van Rijn, Bart Visser, Jan Peter van der Wenden. This new board works, according to its judgement, together with the staff and management of Paradiso, as well as the Interfaculty of Image and Sound: Pierre Ballings, Kees Brienen, Martijn Jansen, Frans Evers, Gepke Bouma.<br>						<br>						For the upcoming 7th edition of Sonic Acts, this new board decided on a string of related themes from its own experiences, fascinations and observations in contemporary arts and culture. Especially a shared fascination for the ingenious structures, music and sounds of the early classic&#18; computer-games (Pong, Space-invaders, Pacman) forms the leading motive for the programme. The editorial board decided on four related themes: games, pixel, arcade, landscape.<br>						<br>						Both nights of Sonic Acts 2000, evening- and night-programmes, are built with new - preferably newly created - projects of image, music, sound and performance. The programme will show a carefully balanced mix of work by young, starting artists, students even, and the work of more experienced artists performing the international stage.<br>						The board of Sonic Acts 2000 selects projects and acts on the bases of their contemporary relevance, relation to the four themes or motives, performance qualities, and the relation between image and sound within.<br>						<br>						Besides a this programme of performances and acts, the editorial board of Sonic Acts 2000 also creates an environment in which both the artists and the audience will find interesting, stirring and surprising mixtures of art, culture, dance, some fun, as well as carefully guarded opportunity for improvisation and ad hoc-co-operation between artists and guests. </font></td>				</tr>			</table>		</center>	</body></html>
