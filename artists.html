ADULT. brings to the electronic music scene a unique sound, combining the raw analog synthesizers and drum boxes of the early 80&Mac185;s, with the attitude of old school punk, and the current complexity of post-modern computer music. As Peter Shapiro said in<br>						THE WIRE (11/99) &quot;[ADULT. has] that fuck-you attitude that&Mac185;s so rare in electronic music.&quot; ADULT. has released 5 12&quot; records on Ersatz Audio (Detroit),<br>						Clone Records (Rotterdam), and Electrecord (K&Mac246;ln) under the pseudonym PLASMA CO. ADULT. has remixed over a dozen acts such as Tuxedomoon (coming out soon), Ectomorph, Gerhard Potuznik, and the 1970&Mac185;s Viennese disco group&Mac173; Ganymed. ADULT.&Mac185;s live set defies the traditional electronic show with its edgy vocals, fast pace, and blurring of genres. As Hobey Echlin wrote in Mixer Magazine, Adult. is &quot;...Flying Lizards-meets-Kraftwerk... Twisted but tight, these robots are too fucked-up to be funky, which is probably why this is so damn good.&quot;<br>						<br>						<a name="Anchor-Phoenecia-11481"></a><a href="http://www.schematic.net" target="_blank"><b>Phoenecia</b></a><br>						(Maimi/USA-Schematic)<br>						<br>						Dj/producers (Schematic Records) Josh Kay and Romulo Del Castillo are Phoenecia. The duo began producing hip-hop influenced electronic music as Soul Oddity during the mid-'90s. Elements of Miami bass, electro, ambient<br>						and drum and bass are scattered about their sparse, minimalist soundscapes.<br>						Their sound is fractured, non-linear and on the experimental tip; intelligent dance music for those looking beyond the horizon of accessible electronic dance music.<br>						<br>						<a name="Anchor-LIKE-35882"></a><a href="http://www.likeatim.com" target="_blank"><b>LIKE A TIM</b></a><br>						(Nl / Dub - Djax up beats - Rephlex)<br>						<br>						Under the pseudonym of Like a Tim, Tim van Leijden is making a musical career with a very extra ordinary sound.

He prepares a new live-set and will premier at the Sonic Acts 2000.

Roel and Don Funcken take their music very serious, but smile when asked how they make it al sound so complex. &quot;We found out pretty quickly, how to create complex beats in a very easy way&quot;.Thus far their experiments resulted in three ep's on the Dutch imprint Djak-Up-Bitch (D.U.B.) and a few contributions on compilations and for other labels. Still on the shelf are releases on Funkst&ouml;rungs label Musik Aus Strom and Isophlux.<br>						FUNCKARMA Parts DUBCD2 CD This has been out on preorder for a while and will finally arrive in the next week or so. After 3 very well received EP's by the talented Dutch brothers Funcken, DUB is proud to present their first full length CD<br>						album. Although they are often compared to Funkstorung, Autechre and Black Dog / Plaid, this dynamic duo shows that they have a style of their own. Having a background in hip hop and electro, they have a fetish for disassembled beats. Combining this with their knowledge of modern equipment (one of the brothers is electronics engineer and builds recording studios and the other brother is student of (Sonology) leads to very innovative drum and sound programming. For the CD, they picked one track from each previous record and added 8 new tracks, all which are quite diverse and show the different sides of Funckarma. Deep, moody and melancholic tracks are met by more energetic rhythmic tracks. The album is a collection of various moods but is tied together by the atmosphere and melodies.<br>						<b><br>						<a name="Anchor-Phako-23240"></a>Phako</b><br>						(Nl /Dub-records-Clone)<br>						<br>						Remco de Jong who works under the pseudonym Phako since three years is developing himself on wide variety of dissiplinces.

For 19 years we have concentrated on new and experimental music. Where most organisations measure their success in terms of sales or riding the crest of the latest trends, Staalplaat was created to discover the rough diamonds, to take risks and embrace all surprises. The centre of Staalplaat's strategy is to invest in the future by stimulating new sounds, establishing and supporting new routes, connecting artists with new improvisational themes and experimental music ideas, the exchange and exploration of different metamusical concepts and thus expanding the boundaries of what we call &quot;music.&quot;<br>						Up to the year 2000 we have produced over 300 audio releases by artists such as Muslimgauze, Rapoon, Ryoji Ikeda, Charlemagne Palestine, Jim O' Rourke, and many others. Staaltape as a label has a strong opinion on artwork and packaging. In the past we used hand made laser cut paper, CDs in leather ( Illusion of Safety with a real bullet!), stolen Soviet army badges and lots more. In our Mort Aux Vaches series we produce a wide variety of materials, such as paper, plastic and sand paper.<br>						<br>						</font></td>				</tr>			</table>		</center>	</body></html>
